# Help Center Diagnostic

Example of the accompanying code of a diagnostic where I would: 
- Scrape a Help Center
- Run it through the preprocessing
- Analyze the data in Google Sheets
- Critique the UX/design of the Help Center
- Create accompanying Tableau dashboard
- Send off a deck with findings

Thanks to Maria McCann for allowing me to use this code as part of my portfolio!
